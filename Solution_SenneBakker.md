# Beer consumption
Looking at the plots shown below, it can be seen that the absolute beer consumption rises significantly, from 2013 to 2018. The increase in beer consumption over that same period is approximately 5%. Before 2014, from 2006 until 2014, beer consumption was approximately constant, with little fluctuations.

However, when looking at the relative beer consumption in that period, we see that university students are drinking less beer. The increase in absolute beer consumption seems to be connected to the increase of number of students. The number of students rose with approximately 36%. This can also be seen in the relative beer consumption shown below.

The beer consumption per capita decreases quite steadily over the period from 2006 to 2018. It decreases with approximately 20%. 

However, the numbers in the data seem to be a bit off. In the sense that it shows that every university student drinks about 4400 liters beer in a year. This corresponds to an average of almost 85 liters of beer every week, which is a ridiculous amount.
