## Analysis of the Beer consumption data

![Beer consumption vs number of university students in NL](beer_consumption.png)

From the image above it looks like that the consumption of alcohol in the Netherlands increases as the number of university\
going students increases. Unfortunately, this data is not sufficient to establish correlation between these factors. \
But anyway, a hypothesis can be given. Students, as a group, tend to drink a lot more as compared to other groups in the society.\
Another hypothesis could be that after getting a university degree, an individual can afford to buy more amount of beer.
