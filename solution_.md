### Interpretation of the figure
The figure above shows the amount of university students per year with the values on the left hand side corresponding to the red graph and beer consumption in the Netherlands with the values on the right hand side corresponding to the blue graph. One can see a sharp increase in students from around 2008 till 2012. In the same time period beer consumption stays relatively the same with no major increases or decreases. However the beer consumption has an increase after 2012, almost as if it is catching up with the increase in uni students. There seems to be some sort of correlation between the two data sets. Intuitively this makes sense as the university student life style involves a copious amount of beer. So more university students would result in more beer consumption overall.
