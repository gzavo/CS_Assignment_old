The data shows that both the amount of WO's (Warrant officers) and the beer consumption have seen a strong incline from 2014 till 2018.
But there does not seem to be a direct correlation because: the shape of the graphs seems notably different and changes in one graph do not incite changes in the other.
In conclusion, it is unlikely that the amount of WO and beer consumption correlate.
