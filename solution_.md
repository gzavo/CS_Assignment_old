# WO vs Beer Consumption in NL
![WO vs Beer Consumption in NL](plot.png)

The graph above depicts the percentage increase of the university student population and the beer consumption percentage increase in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2018. The data were converted to % increases so that they can be related to eachother in a more meaningful way. The WO line has an almost steady positive trend throughout the years, with a small decrease in 2013. As for the NL beer consumption data, there is no notable increase or decrease until 2012, when the line starts rising, but with a much lower slope than the WO line. After studying the graph, one can find no strong correlation between the two categories. The increase in students, does increase the beer consumption, but only in the expected degree, since there are more people who can drink. NL Beer consumpution does not seem to be that much dependent on students, since it is steady for the first half of the diagram, even though students do increase. However, on the second half, it does rise with increasing students, but this increase could also be due to the increase in some other population category in the Netherlands.
