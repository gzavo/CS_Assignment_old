<p>This plot visualizes the relation between the amount of students (WO = wetenschappelijk onderwijs?) and the beer consumption in the netherlands. Up until approximately 245.000 students, there appears to be no clear indication to assume correlation. Beyond more than 245.000 students, there appears to be some indication of correlation, showing an arguably linear trend upwards (an increase in students goes hand in hand with an increase in beer consumption). </p>
