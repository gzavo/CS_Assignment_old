We have made two plots where we see Year on the x-axis and WO or beer consumption on y-axis. See
[githubfig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91411389/134807499-7013cc4b-1d20-42f8-80c6-6eb9ebf79e2d.jpg) and
[githubfig2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91411389/134807495-8bdd6cc2-667a-457a-bc4e-6f2470e27c3e.jpg).
The correlation between WO students and beer consumption is 0.8180643555130895, which is very high. 
There is a strong (0.818 is almost 1) positive relationship between the two, if one of the two increases it is likely that the other increases as well.
