![Plot of amount of students versus year](Figure_1.png)

In the above plot you can see the amount of students in WO versus the year. As you can see, there is a clear correlation between the two variables. While the data did also include the beer consumption in the Netherlands, this unfortunately does not have such a clear correlation with the amount of WO students. Thus, we can conclude the number of WO students steadily increases as time goes on.
